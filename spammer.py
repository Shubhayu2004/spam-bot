  What do you think, buzzy-boy?
  
  
  Dad, you surprised me.
  
  
  
    
    
    You decide what you're interested in?
    
      
      
      - Well, there's a lot of choices.
      
      - But you only get one.
      
      
      
      - I'm going out.
      
      - Out? Out where?
      
      
      
        
        
        - Out there.

  Like what? Give me one example.



    


    Right.
      

      Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
      
      and the ladies see you wearing it.
      
      
      
        
        
        Those ladies?
        
        Aren't they our cousins too?
        
        
        
          
          
          Distant. Distant.
          
          
          
            
            
            Look at these two.
            
            
            
              
              
              - Oouple of Hive Harrys.
              
              - Let's have fun with them.

                  Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
                  
                  against a mushroom!
                  
                  
                    
                    
                    He had a paw on my throat,
                    
                    and with the other, he was slapping me!
                    
                    
                    
                      
                      
                      - Oh, my!
                      
                      - I never I'd knock him out.
                      
                      
                      
                        
                        
                        What were you doing during this?
                        
                        
                          
                          
                          Trying to alert the authorities.
                          
                          
                          
                            
                            
                            I can autograph that.

                            wasn't it, comrades?
                            
                            
                              
                              
                              Yeah. Gusty.
